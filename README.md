# 2048 Puzzle Game

Welcome to the 2048 puzzle game! This project is an implementation of the popular 2048 game using JavaScript. 

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. You can move the tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. 

- When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of their numbers.
- After every move, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4.
- The game ends when there are no more possible moves left or when you reach the 2048 tile.
